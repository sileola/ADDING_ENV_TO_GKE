___

On the GCP console, locate the Kubernetes Engine Service.

Next, click on `Clusters` and select the cluster you intend to work on.

Next, click on `CONNECT` and copy the command that pops up. It looks like the command below:


`gcloud container clusters get-credentials max-staging-cluster --zone europe-west3-a --project max-infra-staging`


Paste the code on your local terminal to authenticate.

Next, login to Github and click on the repo you whcih to work on. In this case *max-third-party-service-charts*

Locate the deployment file in this path `max-third-party-service-charts/charts/max-third-party-service/templates/`

Go to your local terminal and locate the pod you are working on. Use the command below to grep the output:

`kubectl get pods | grep third`

Enter into the pod with this commmand:

`kubectl exec -it max-third-party-service-f55b8f6bd-cxhsb -- /bin/bash `

Grep the `env` file to be certain that the new env variables are currently nonexisting in the env file.

You can use the commands below:

`env | grep AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

Check for all other envs as necessary.

Exit the pod with the `exit` command.

On github, edit the deployment.yaml file and input the new envs.

Commit the changes

To monitor the workflow, check the repo on CircleCI.

On the local terminal, run the command below:


`kubectl describe pods  max-third-party-service-f55b8f6bd-cxhsb`

Copy `max-third-party-service-secrets`

Next, run the command below to edit the secrets:

`kubectl edit secret max-third-party-service-secrets`

Open a new terminal and encode each value of the given envs using base64, by running the command below:

`echo -n <env-value> | base64`

Enter the encoded envs in the `Secrets` file that is opened and save it.
